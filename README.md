### Analysis of Data
The population of NYC is approximately 8.4 million while Des Moines is approximately 215,000 making the population of Des Moines 2.5% of NYC's population. With that scale in mind, looking at the number of rides overall and at peak times and expectation for rides in Des Moines can be understood. Overall, there are 2,344,224 rides in NYC so at a 2.5% ratio it can be expected if overall use is the same that the number of rides in Des Moines will be approximately 58,605. At the peak time for rides in NYC, the number of rides is 9,740 so the peak number rides to likely expect in Des Moines will be approximately 243.

The data indicates that the majority of riders are male and they are mostly riding in the morning and evenings on weekdays for less than 20 minutes. Additionally, they are mostly subscribers to the service versus customers taking individual rides.

The overall data for combined genders on duration of trips and checkout times is equivalent to the data analyzed according to gender. The likely conclusion is that riders are using the bike sharing service as means of commuting to work.
