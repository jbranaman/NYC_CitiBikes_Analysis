## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is assemble bike sharing data from NYC to create an analysis of the data in a visual format to convince investors that a bike sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa is valid.

### Analysis of Data
The population of NYC is approximately 8.4 million while Des Moines is approximately 215,000 making the population of Des Moines 2.5% of NYC's population. With that scale in mind, looking at the number of rides overall and at peak times and expectation for rides in Des Moines can be understood. Overall, there are 2,344,224 rides in NYC so at a 2.5% ratio it can be expected if overall use is the same that the number of rides in Des Moines will be approximately 58,605. At the peak time for rides in NYC, the number of rides is 9,740 so the peak number rides to likely expect in Des Moines will be approximately 243.

The first visualization below shows the trip durations by gender showing male usage to be predominant. The second visualization shows trips by gender by weekday per hour showing males predominantly using the service Monday through Friday in the mornings and evenings. The third visualization shows the number of rides by gender, day and user type showing male subscribers predominantly using the service Monday through Friday. The fourth visualization shows the gender breakdown for the number of rides showing males to be predominantly using the service. In summary, the data indicates that the majority of riders are male and they are mostly riding in the morning and evenings on weekdays for less than 20 minutes. Additionally, they are mostly subscribers to the service versus customers taking individual rides.

The first visualization below shows the numbers of rides by trip duration showing that most trips are 5 minutes and the majority overall are less than 20 minutes. The second visualization shows the number of rides by day of the week and the time of day showing that most trips are taken Monday through Friday in the morning and the evening and that some trips are happening in the middle of the day on Saturdays. In summary, the overall data for combined genders on duration of trips and checkout times is equivalent to the data analyzed according to gender. The likely conclusion is that riders are using the bike sharing service as means of commuting to work.

## Summary
The results overall indicate that based on the population ratio between the two cities Des Moines could likely have 2.5% of the bike sharing rides NYC has and that the bikes will be more likely used by males for the purpose of commuting to work.

A couple of additional visualizations that could be considered useful for analysis are:
* The number of rides and their duration by age group to help determine the predominant age of riders and their usage.
* The number of rides, their duration and the time taken by user type to determine how customers versus subscribers are using the bike sharing service.
